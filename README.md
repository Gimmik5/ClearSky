Manage the development of the ClearSky project by Gideon Bergbaum
An ESP-32 cam development board and a python server will be developed together to detect if the next nightsky will be a clear night or not. 

Step 1 - Record regular images and provide them clear or not ratings. 
Step 2 - Provide additional sensor and power source to work autonomously overnight. 
Step 3 - Record multiple nights data in a row and use a machine learning algorithm to predict the next night. 
Step 4 - Connect to external sources for additional night sky events + send notifications.
